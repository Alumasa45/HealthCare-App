# Healthcare App Fix Summary

## Issues Addressed & Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Cart Sharing Between Patient and Pharmacist Accounts** âœ… FIXED

**Problem**: Cart was shared across all users using the same browser because it used a generic localStorage key.

**Solution**:

- Updated `CartContext.tsx` to use user-specific localStorage keys
- Format: `healthcare-cart-${userId}` instead of `healthcare-cart`
- Added automatic cart clearing when users log out or switch accounts
- Added user authentication context to cart provider

**Files Modified**:

- `frontend/src/contexts/CartContext.tsx`

### 2. **Pharmacy Creation Form Validation Error** âœ… FIXED

**Problem**: "Please fill in all required fields" error when creating new pharmacy due to missing form fields.

**Solution**:

- Added missing required fields: `User_id`, `Opening_Time`, `Closing_Time`
- Updated form validation to check all required fields
- Added placeholders and proper input types
- Enhanced error messaging to show which fields are required

**Files Modified**:

- `frontend/src/components/dashboards/PharmacistDashboard.tsx`

### 3. **Inventory Not Reflecting Products** ðŸ”§ DEBUGGING ENHANCED

**Problem**: Inventory showing zero items even when products exist in HealthPlus Pharmacy.

**Solution**:

- Added comprehensive console logging to debug inventory fetch process
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback
- Added manual refresh functionality
- Added debug information showing pharmacy ID and fetch results
- Improved inventory loading states and error messages

**Files Modified**:

- `frontend/src/api/pharmacyInventory.ts`
- `frontend/src/components/dashboards/PharmacistDashboard.tsx`

### 4. **Sidebar Navigation Filtering** âœ… FIXED

**Problem**: All navigation items shown to all user types (Appointments, Medical Records, Prescriptions showing to Pharmacists).

**Solution**:

- Implemented role-based navigation filtering
- **Pharmacist**: Dashboard, Chat, Billing, Settings only
- **Patient**: Dashboard, Appointments, Medical Records, Prescriptions, Chat, Billing, Settings
- **Doctor**: Dashboard, Appointments, Medical Records, Prescriptions, Chat, Billing, Settings, Manage Appointments

**Files Modified**:

- `frontend/src/components/Sidebar.tsx`

### 5. **Landing Page Button Update** âœ… FIXED

**Problem**: "Book Appointment" button should redirect to dashboard or login based on authentication status.

**Solution**:

- Changed button text to "View Dashboard" for logged-in users, "Get Started" for non-logged-in
- Added authentication-based redirect logic
- Redirects to `/dashboard` if logged in, `/auth` if not logged in

**Files Modified**:

- `frontend/src/routes/index.tsx`

## Technical Implementation Details

### Cart Isolation

```typescript
// Before (shared)
localStorage.getItem("healthcare-cart");

// After (user-specific)
const getCartKey = () => {
  if (!user?.User_id) return "healthcare-cart-guest";
  return `healthcare-cart-${user.User_id}`;
};
```

### Role-Based Navigation

```typescript
const getNavigationItems = () => {
  const userType = user?.User_Type;

  const userSpecificItems = [
    {
      to: "/appointments",
      icon: CalendarCheck2,
      label: "Appointments",
      show: userType === "Patient" || userType === "Doctor",
    },
    // ... other items
  ].filter((item) => item.show);
};
```

### Enhanced Debugging

- Added comprehensive console logs to pharmacy and inventory APIs
- Added manual refresh buttons with detailed logging
- Enhanced error messages with specific information

## Testing & Verification

### To Test Cart Isolation:

1. Login as Patient â†’ Add items to cart
2. Logout and login as Pharmacist â†’ Cart should be empty
3. Switch back to Patient â†’ Previous cart items should be restored

### To Test Sidebar Filtering:

1. Login as different user types and verify navigation items
2. Pharmacist should NOT see: Appointments, Medical Records, Prescriptions
3. Patient/Doctor should see all relevant items

### To Test Pharmacy Creation:

1. Fill all required fields (marked with \*)
2. Should create successfully without validation errors
3. New pharmacy should appear in the list

### To Debug Inventory Issues:

1. Check browser console for detailed logs
2. Use manual refresh button to test inventory fetching
3. Verify pharmacy ID matches between user and inventory

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Inventory Data**: Check if products are assigned to correct pharmacy ID in database
2. **Test User Flows**: Validate each user type gets appropriate navigation and functionality
3. **Database Check**: Ensure HealthPlus Pharmacy ID matches the current user's pharmacy association
4. **API Verification**: Test all pharmacy and inventory endpoints are working correctly

## Files Modified Summary

- `frontend/src/contexts/CartContext.tsx` - Cart isolation
- `frontend/src/components/dashboards/PharmacistDashboard.tsx` - Pharmacy form + inventory debugging
- `frontend/src/components/Sidebar.tsx` - Role-based navigation
- `frontend/src/routes/index.tsx` - Landing page button
- `frontend/src/api/pharmacyInventory.ts` - Enhanced logging

All changes are backward compatible and maintain existing functionality while adding the requested improvements.
